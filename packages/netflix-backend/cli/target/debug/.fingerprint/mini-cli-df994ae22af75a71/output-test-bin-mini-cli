Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src\\main.rs","byte_start":1866,"byte_end":1880,"line_start":56,"line_end":56,"column_start":25,"column_end":39,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            for line in reader.lines() {","highlight_start":25,"highlight_end":39}],"label":"doesn't have a size known at compile-time","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"src\\main.rs","byte_start":1854,"byte_end":3069,"line_start":56,"line_end":76,"column_start":13,"column_end":14,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"            for line in reader.lines() {","highlight_start":13,"highlight_end":41},{"text":"                if let Ok(line) = line {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":41},{"text":"                    if let Ok(json) = serde_json::from_str::<Value>(&line) {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":77},{"text":"                        if let Some(obj) = json.as_object() {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":62},{"text":"                            if obj.get(\"type\").and_then(|v| v.as_str()) == Some(\"metrics\") {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":93},{"text":"                                let cpu = obj.get(\"cpu\").and_then(|v| v.as_f64()).unwrap_or(0.0);","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":98},{"text":"                                let mem = obj.get(\"mem\").and_then(|v| v.as_f64()).unwrap_or(0.0);","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":98},{"text":"                                let latency = obj.get(\"latency\").and_then(|v| v.as_f64()).unwrap_or(0.0);","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":106},{"text":"                                if let Ok(mut mt) = metrics_clone.lock() {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":75},{"text":"                                    *mt = format!(\"CPU: {:.1}% | MEM: {:.1}MB | Latency: {:.1}ms\", cpu, mem, latency);","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":119},{"text":"                                }","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":34},{"text":"                                continue;","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":42},{"text":"                            }","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":30},{"text":"                        }","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":26},{"text":"                    }","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":22},{"text":"                    if let Ok(mut logs) = logs_clone.lock() {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":62},{"text":"                        logs.push((format!(\"ENGINE → {}\", line), Color::White));","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":81},{"text":"                        if logs.len() > 1000 { logs.remove(0);
